\section{Design}
The design is based on, and almost equivalent with the design described in the
book. The focus of this section is to highlight and explain the differences
between the two, rather than describing it in detail. For further details on the
design see \cite{patterson12}.
\subsection{Memory address space}
Since the memory is synthesized with $2^8$ addresses, constants were redefined
throughout the project to reflect this, thus avoiding a large number of
synthesize warnings regarding unused address bits. The only functional change
this implies is a simplification of the jump instruction, where it only needs
the eight least significant bits of the immediate value. Given that this design
is to be implemented on an FPGA, it seems reasonable to reduce the address
space from 512 MiB to 256 bit.

\subsection{Pipeline registers}
Since the DMEM, IMEM and register file components synthesize into block ram, the
need for additional pipeline registers storing these values dissappear.
Including these would introduce a delay in the propagation of the corresponding
signals. These registers have therefore been removed, and some steps had to be
taken to maintain equal functionality. For instance, the flushing of the IF/ID
instruction register has to happen dynamically, in a VHDL-process operating on
