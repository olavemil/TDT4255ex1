In the same way as for the last exercise a hierarchical structure was used, where the processor had each stage as a component. This was done to provide abstraction, and simplify the implementation. The component called \emph{pipeline\_stage1} consists of traditional pipeline stages 0 and 1, since each of these are relatively small. Stage two was mostly implemented the way it was designed, but the hazard detection unit and control unit were placed here, since most signals connecting to these units go to stage 2. Other than this stage 5 was excluded, since the program counter was implemented in stage 1 and the rest of the logic fit better in the processor component itself. The forwarding unit was also placed here.
\subsection{Processor core}
The processor core itself was implemented as a messenger between the pipeline stages, similarly to how toplevel was with respect to the core, com and mem units. To make it obvious where a signal came from each was prefixed with stage\_\#\_out\_, since many signals have the same name in different stages. In addition, all component definitions and port maps were grouped and documented according to where they were connected, making it easy to detect a desired signal.
\bf{TODO: decide on whether mem access will belong to components and be registered, or belong to processor and go unregistered, base on testing/timing results.}

\subsection{Control unit}
\bf{TODO: changes to the control unit from last time}
\subsection{Hazards}
\bf{TODO: choices regarding implementation of hazard control, including, but not limited to, forwarding, stalling, flushing and branching.}
emph{Forwarding data from MEM to EX with the forwarding should fix most issues.\\}
emph{We have implemented the simple branch prediction described in the book (assume it will fall through), and the optimization moving the branch logic to stage 2 (ID). We do not currently forward values to the branching check!\\}
emph{Hazard detection unit should stall the pipeline necessary. More info on this when it is confirmed or fixed.\\}
