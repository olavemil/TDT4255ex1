The approach to testing the FPGA design was done in three separate stages:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item First through Xilinx's \cite{xilinx-ise} own syntax check and
synthesizing of the VHDL code.
	\item Then through simulation of the VHDL implemented FPGA design in
ModelSim \cite{modelsim}.
	\item Finally by configuring the FPGA with the VHDL code, testing is
continued on the FPGA itself through the use of COM ports.
\end{enumerate}

While there has been spent a lot of time and effort on testing, we chose a small
selection which the report elaborates on in the following subsections.\newpage
