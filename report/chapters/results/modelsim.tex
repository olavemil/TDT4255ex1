\subsection{First error found}
The first error we encountered when simulating our processor design in ModelSim
\cite{modelsim}, was an error where \emph{pipeline\_stage1} gives an undefined
value as output every second clockcycle.
\paragraph*{}
Figure \ref{fig:error-1-text} below illustrates the problem:
\input{figures/error_1_text}
\paragraph*{}
This problem was caused by the program counter's input in
\emph{pipeline\_stage1} not being properly connected to the adder incrementing
program counter's output. This problem was resolved by connecting the output
from the adder correctly into the multiplexor choosing between the adder and
branch values as inputs for the program counter.

\subsection{Second error found}
The second error encountered was when simulating the entire pipeline design as
a whole to check whether instructions as a whole propagated correctly.
\paragraph*{}
It was discovered (as figure \ref{fig:error-2-text} illustrates) that due to the
bottom signal ``stage\_4\_out\_wb'' being undeclared until the ALU operations unit
sends the load/store command to the ALU. The consequence of this is that until
the abovementioned signals stops being undefined, garbage is written back to the
registers in \emph{pipeline\_stage2}.
