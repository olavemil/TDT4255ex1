Since the simulation phase never was completed, no attempt was made to verify
the design on the FPGA. Given a working implementation, this verification would
have followed the same procedure as for the previous exercise.
\paragraph*{}
Testing would have consisted of running several smaller programs on the FPGA
where we only tested a few instructions in each one. These tests would already
be written from the previous assigment and could easily pinpoint problems.
