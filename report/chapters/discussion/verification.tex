Since the simulation phase never was completed no attempt was made to verify the design on the FPGA. Given a working implementation, the verification would have followed the same procedure as for the previous exercise.

Testing would have consisted of running several smaller programs on the FPGA where we only tested a few instructions in each one. These tests would already be written from the previous assigment and could easily pinpoint problems.
