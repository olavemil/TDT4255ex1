Testing was done in the same way as for the previous exercise, using the
toplevel testbench while examining the signals in subcomponents, but with some
component specific tests.
\paragraph*{}
Much of the time was spent trying to find out why the values from the register
file was wrong, and many bugs were found and fixed in the forwarding unit, the
stage 2, and stage 3 components. Despite these bugfixes the values still came
out wrong. The test run consisted of three load operations followed by one
addition, using the values from the previous loads. We never got these to work
properly together, and when testing the other instructions, we encountered the
same problems. We think many of the problems were not with the components
themselves, but with the connections in the piplined core. The test itself was
considered to perform acceptably.

But the main development problem was that the testing was done too late. This
due to the scheduling conflicts with the course TDT4195, which consumed too much time before the deadline.
