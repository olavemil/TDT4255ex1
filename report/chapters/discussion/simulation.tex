Testing was done in the same was as for the previous exercise, using the
toplevel testbench while examining the signals in subcomponents, but with some
component specific tests.\textbf{TODO: add more content}
\paragraph*{}
Much of the time was spent trying to find out why the values from the register
file was wrong, and many bugs were found and fixed in the forwarding unit, the
stage 2, and stage 3 components. Despite these bugfixes the values still came
out wrong. The test run consisted of three load operations followed by one
addition, using the values from the previous loads. When these tests performed
correctly the rest of the program would be run, but since they never did, it
was not be meaningful to check the result of the whole test. The test itself was
considered to perform acceptably.

But the main development problem was that the testing was done too late. This
because of schedule conflicts with the course TDT4195 which consumed much of the
time before the deadline.
