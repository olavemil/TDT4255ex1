Some thought was put into the implementation of the design, regarding how to split the design into components. A natural division, which allowed for a parallell work flow was to implement each stage of the pipeline in its own stage. Another idea was to implement the pipeline registers in their own components, but this was dismissed due to the increased complexity this would have caused the processor component.\\
Another way to do this would be to place the pipeline registers in their own files, and include those in the stage components, but this would also introduce a lot of signals into the stage components themselves. A final option would be to only have the processor components including pipeline registers as separate units, and the rest as one file, but it would not let everyone work at once.\\
It is harder to advocate the specific implementation of the design, since it seems not to work perfectly. Most ideas that were implemented worked as intended, and problems mostly related to the unkown behaviour of the DMEM, IMEM and register file components.\\
Not knowing whether these would be implemented as registers or not, since the components described behaved differently than the ones synthesizing to BRAM, provided confusion and problems in accessing the data from these. Access to DMEM and IMEM worked as intended in the final product, but a problem persisted where the register file (or possibly the forwarding units) only returned zero, instead of the value in the register. This problem made it hard to test further functionality or the implementation.
