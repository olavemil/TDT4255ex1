Basing the design on the one given in the book, referenced in section
\ref{intro:approach}, simplified the development process. No major changes were
implemented from the design from the book.
\paragraph*{}
For this reason we believe that the design itself is good, and that problems lie
in the conceptual implementation of the design. Given enough time to
test/implement additional instructions, further optimizations could have been
implemented. But focusing first on passing the minimum requirements appears to
have remained a good decision.
