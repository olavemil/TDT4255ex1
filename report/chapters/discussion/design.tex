Basing the design on the one given in the book simplified the development process, and no big changes were made, other than those deemed neccessary to make it work in an FPGA. For this reason it is believed that the design itself is good, and that problems lie in the implementation of the design. Given enough time additional instructions and further optimizations could have been implemented, but focusing on passing the minimum requirements first appears to have been a good decision.
