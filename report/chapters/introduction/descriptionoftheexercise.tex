\section{Description of the exercise}

For this assignment, the design from the previous assignment was to be extended
with pipelining, hazard control and related optimizations. These are all steps
that aim to improve the efficiency and throughput of the processor. While much
of the structure remained the same, many of the components had to be modified,
or re-written entirely.

\subsection{Exercise requirements}
\emph{The task as stated in the compendium \cite{compendium}.}\newline
\textbf{\emph{``The major requirement of this assignment is a simple 5-stage
pipelined processor. In general, the processor has the same functional
requirements as in the previous assignment. Additionally, you need to implement
different hazard detection and correction techniques.''}}
\paragraph*{}
The following ordering of goals were:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Divide the processor into the five pipeline stages.
	\item Re-use code that that is compatible with the new pipeline design.
	\item Implement forwarding.
	\item Implement data hazard detection and correction with stalling.
	\item Implement control hazard avoidance with improved branching and
flushing.
\end{enumerate}
