\section{Description of the exercise}

For this assignment, the design from the previous assignment was to be extended
 with pipelining, hazard control and optimizations relating to this. These are all
 steps that aim to improve the efficiency and throughput of the processor. While
 much of the structure remained the same, many components had to be refined,
 or written from scratch.

\subsection{Assignment requirements}
\emph{The task as stated in the compendium \cite{compendium}.}\newline
``The major requirement of this assignment is a simple 5-stage pipelined
processor. In general, the processor has the same functional requirements as in
the previous assignment. Additionally, you need to implement different hazard
detection and correction techniques.''
\paragraph*{}
The goals for this assignment has therefore been, in the following order:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Divide the processor into pipeline stages.
	\item Reuse code that can be reused.
	\item Implement forwarding.
	\item Implement data hazard detection and correction with stalling.
	\item Implement control hazard avoidance with improved branching and flushing.
\end{enumerate}
