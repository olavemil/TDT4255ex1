Our approach to the task has been an iterative approach. Firstly, we aimed for a
design based on a diagram on slide 58 from a Course lecture \cite{slides-6}.
This slide illustrates a pipelined design which components resemble previous
assignment in this course very closely. Due to this, we decided to start by
converting the functioning processor design from the previous assignment into a
pipelined processor based on the design on the abovementioned diagram.
\paragraph*{}
This diagram is taken from the book \cite{patterson12}, on page 362. Since the
design has been thought through by the books authors, and is well described in
their book, we had few problems implementing this first version of our processor
design.
\paragraph*{}
Following the approach of the authors through the chapters of the book, we
started to work towards a more complex design including hazard controls by way
of forwarding and stalling. Slide 57 from lecture \cite{slides-7} illustrates
the functional architecture of our final processor design. This design builds
upon the previous one with several improvements, which include the forwarding
unit and the hazard control unit.

Finally, when the design was completed, we tested it out in the lab to discover
any errors not previously found in our design (and subsequently fixin them).
