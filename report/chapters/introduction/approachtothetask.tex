Our approach to the task has been an iterative approach. Slide 58 on the
\emph{Pipelining} \cite{slides-6} course lecture illustrates a pipelined design
whose components resemble the previous assignment in this course very closely.
Due to this, we decided to start by converting the functioning processor design
from the previous assignment into a pipelined processor based on the design on
the abovementioned diagram.
\paragraph*{}
This diagram is taken from the book \cite{patterson12}, on page 362, and since
the design has been thought through by the books authors, and is well described
in said book, we had few problems implementing this first version of our
processor design.
\paragraph*{}
Following the approach of the authors through the chapters of the book, we
started to work towards a more complex design including hazard controls by way
of forwarding and stalling. Slide 57 from lecture \cite{slides-7} illustrates
the functional architecture of our final processor design. This design builds
upon the previous one with several improvements, which include the forwarding
unit and the hazard control unit.

Finally, when the design was completed, we tested it out in the lab to discover
any errors not previously found in our design (and subsequently fixing them).
