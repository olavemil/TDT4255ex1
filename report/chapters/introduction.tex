\section{Challenges with pipelined design}

Working on the design and implementation of a pipelined processor compared to a
Multi-Cycle processor, differs mainly in its level of complexity.
\paragraph*{}
There are many reasons for why a pipelined processor is more complex, but we
struggled mostly with the signals propagations, the pipeline stages
interlocking, and the added hazard control logic.
\paragraph*{}
Since splitting the components into different pipelines (yet having said stages
working in an interlocked fashion), results in having just as many, if not more
signals to keep in mind and under control than a Multi-Cycle processor. And due
to the pipelines working in an interlocked fashion, another level of difficulty
is introduced when making sure that all the signals propagate throughout the
pipeline correctly.
\paragraph*{}
Implementing the added hazard control logic through the \emph{forwarding} and
\emph{hazard detection} components also added more complexity to the processor
design as a whole, instead of simply being new components containing complex
circuitry and logic.
