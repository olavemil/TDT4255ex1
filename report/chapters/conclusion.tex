\chapter{Conclusion}
While it is disappointing that the design was not successfully implemented and
tested, considering the significant amount of time spent on development, the
group agrees that the process has been educational with regards to how pipelining
works on a processor. The experience gained from this exercise has been helpful
in pipelining the TDT4295 project, and has given us a new perspective on what
happens when software instructions runs inside a modern processor.
\paragraph*{}
The group is content, though not necessarily satisfied with the product, and is
of the opinion that if the deadlines of the two courses had not been so close,
the end result would have been better.
