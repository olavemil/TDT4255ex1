\chapter{Conclusion}
While it is dissapointing that the design was not successfully implemented and
tested, considering the significant amount of time spent on development, the 
group agrees that the process has been educational with regard to pipelining.
The experience gained from this exercise has been helpful in pipelining the 
TDT4295 project, and has given us a new perspective on what happens when 
software runs on a modern processor.
\paragraph*{}
The group is content, if not satisfied with the product, and is of the opinion 
that if the deadlines of the two courses had not been so close, the end result
would have been better.
